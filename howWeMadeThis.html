        <li>
          Git and GitHub - for version control, branching and collaboration on
          the project by multiple members.
        </li>
        <li>
          Netlify - for deployment of our site, ongoing hosting and automated
          deployments from GitHub.
        </li>
        <li>Whimsical - planning and production of wireframe for website. Our board for this project can be seen below.</li>

      <h2 id="method">Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Scoped out and produced a whimsical wireframe board to ensure all team
          members are aware of desired page structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Elected a team member to build a directory using their terminal in
          Amazon Workspaces, initialised it using Git and hosted the repository
          on their GitHub account. Other team members were added as
          collaborators and created a clone of the repository on their local machine. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Team members then began creating individual pages within the project
          with each team member contributing two recipe pages. Version control
          was managed through Git with work being done on new branches. Team
          members ran their code through W3 Validator and once satisfied, pushed
          it to GitHub creating a pull request which was signed off and merged
          by the other team members.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once all recipe pages were constructed, links were added chaining the pages together to the index.html page and the design of the website was tweaked to ensure all pages followed a similar style structure.
